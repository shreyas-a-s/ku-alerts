# Kerala University Alerts

This is a project aimed at simplifying the notification-viewing experience of **Kerala University students**.

This is a website that runs using [Bottle.py](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle) on **Vercel** with **Serverless Functions** using the [Python Runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python) üêç. It can also be run locally for testing and checking it out.

## How it Works

The frontend is built with [React](https://react.dev/) and utilizes [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for managing page navigation.

In backend, it scrapes the University webpages using [selectolax](https://github.com/rushter/selectolax) üï∏Ô∏è, which is a python library that enables easy scraping of html webpages, just like [soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)  üçú which you might know.

It parses the table of notifications üìú to find the latest ones that contain the `course` string and it lists them using a neat-looking table which also contains a link to download each of those notifications  üìé.

For hosting this website, I have used the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) with [Bottle.py](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle)  to enable handling requests on Vercel with **Serverless Functions** ‚òÅÔ∏è. This means I am able to run backend code (**python**) *without* the need for a server, which is pretty cool üöÄ.

## List of Scraped Web Pages

1. **Notifications** Page - https://exams.keralauniversity.ac.in/Login/check1
2. **Timetables** Page - https://exams.keralauniversity.ac.in/Login/check3
3. **Exam Results** Page - https://exams.keralauniversity.ac.in/Login/check8

## Running Locally

```bash
# Install react dependencies
npm install

# Install python dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run frontend and backend separately
npm run dev
python3 api/index.py

# (or) Run both simultaneously
npm run dev & python3 api/index.py
```

The website is now available at `http://localhost:8080` (the **port** might be different. Check the terminal window for the correct port number)
